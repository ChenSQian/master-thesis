# Steps for evaluating/testing

We first use get_file_path.py to generate testing scripts (We need this step because we didn't do testing together with training. Otherwise this step is not necessary.) and do the testing. 

Then we get the testing results and do student's t-test with the notebook get_and_analyze_testing_results.ipynb.
