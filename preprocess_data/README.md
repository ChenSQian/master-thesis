# Steps for preprocessing MANtIS

We first use the negative sampling library from https://github.com/Guzpenha/transformer_rankers. More instructions are written in the negative_sampling.py file. The scripts of running the negative_sampling.py file and running logs are in the jupyter notebook preprocess_mantis.ipynb.

Then we do other preprocessings including adding labels, cleaning and sorting, which are also in the jupyter notebook preprocess_mantis.ipynb.
