# Steps for training and validating

For the curriculum training, we first generate the scoring file based on BERT. The scripts and running logs for generating scoring files are in the transformercl_get_scoring_files.ipynb.

Then we train the BERT with the scoring file and pacing functions. The scripts and running logs are in the training results folder.

Finally we get and analyze the training and validating results with the get_result.ipynb.
