For the curriculum training, we first need to generate the scoring file based on BERT. The scripts and running logs for generating scoring files are in the transformercl_get_scoring_files.ipynb.

Then we can train the BERT with the scoring file and pacing functions. The scripts and running logs are in the training results folder.

Finally we get and analyze the training results with the get_result.ipynb.
